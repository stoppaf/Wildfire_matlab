## General Introduction

Wildfire may cause significant damage to forest and ecosystems. A mathematical 
model of the fire propagation can be used to identify the potential of such a 
catastrophe. 


## The Model

We want to model a section of a fictitious forest with some special elements such: fire 
barriers (e.g. water streams), building, etc. The fire propagation it depends on many 
variables such wind direction, temperature, humidity, etc.


## Fundamental Questions

* [1] How does the wildfire propagate with many different variables (wind, environment 
temperature, humidity, etc.)? [Qualitative]

* [2] How do the parameters of the wildfire change with time (fire temperature, fire 
speed, etc.)? [Quantitative]

* [3] When does the fire stop? (depends on humidity, type of wood, how much of the 
wood is still untouched etc)

## Expected Results

The wildfire will burn the whole forest down and then stop eventually. This process 
won’t be symmetric: Parts of the wood will burn brighter and faster, while others will 
need more time. This depends on many variables described above. The fire will also 
stop at different times at different parts of the wood. A lot depends of whether the tree
types and other conditions are randomized or if there is a scheme (e.g. a whole part of
the wood consists only of trees of type A, the other part is a swamp etc.)

## Research Methods

Cellular Automata

First we want to understand how the parameters influence the behavior of the fire and 
define some formulas that describe the process.
Than we will test different initial conditions and we will analyze the different results 
with graphics and dynamical images.
